# Smart Temperature Sensor — IKT214 Project

Simulation + security assessment of an IoT temperature monitoring system.

## Overview
- MQTT broker (Eclipse Mosquitto)
- Sensor simulator (publishes JSON temperature readings)
- Dashboard (subscriber prints readings)
- Attacker (publishes forged readings to demonstrate integrity issues)
- Secure variant: sensor connects using username/password

## Quick start (demo, insecure)
1. Start broker:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
